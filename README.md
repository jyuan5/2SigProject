**Question:**
Is there a correlation between music taste and ethnicity?

If the individual (Stuy student) was raised in an environment where their ethnicity or their influences' ethnicity is a large part of their upbringing, then the individual's and the major influences' ethnicities are a part of their music taste.

**Where did your idea come from?**
out of the blue ;)

**Are there related articles or research?**
