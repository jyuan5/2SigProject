**Question:**
Is there a correlation between hobbies and music preference?

**Hypothesis:**
Perhaps the type of hobby would influence the music preference of a person. For example, someone who dances as a hobby would listen to music with more beats, such as Pop music. 

**Where did your idea come from?**
Our idea was originally about correlation between race and music perference but we changed it to music and hobbies because there's less factors and more correlation (assumably).

**Are there related articles or research?**
N/A

**What is the data set?**
Our data set consists of responses from various New Yorkers, most of which are our peers (our sphere is very limited, and thus we tried to get some responses from outside of Stuyvesant High School, but majority of our responses are Stuyvesant students.)

**Where did you get it from?**
Our data comes from a survey we conducted, which we posted in school Facebook groups and on our walls. 

**How much data do you have?** 
As of 12:56 AM, 12/18/2017, we have 53 responses (including 

**What time range is covered?**
As of 12:56 AM, 12/18/2017, it has only been approximately 2 hours. 

**Did you have to clean your data? What did you have to do?**
We had to clear out the responses that were not up to standards (for example, some did not put in their zipcodes and that's a perfectly valid concern. However, to submit a response without a zip code...they could've just exited the survey). We also had to check through everyone's hobbies because they did not follow instructions and pick one favorite; instead some just went to the other section and listed their favorite hobbies. For that situation, we either replaced their entry with "Other" in the csv file, or we changed their entry to a choice on the survey that they listed first (for example, someone listed "Photography, transit." We set his entry as Photography. However if his entry had been "transit, Photography," we would've set it as other)>

**Did you notice biases in your data that might affect your results?**
The way we dealt with the hobbies people had was one bias. We're doing this based on an assumption that humans unconsciously list things in an order of perference. However, we have no idea if that truely is the case. Another bias we had were our spheres of influence. It wasn't possible for us, without a social reputation, to ask New Yorkers. For example,
