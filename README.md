**Question:**
Is there a correlation between hobbies and music preference?

**Hypothesis:**
We hypothesize that the type of hobby would influence the music preference of a person. For example, someone who dances as a hobby would listen to music with more beats, such as Pop music. 

**Where did your idea come from?**
Our idea was originally about correlation between race and music perference but we changed it to music and hobbies because there's less factors and more correlation (assumably).

**Are there related articles or research?**
N/A

**What is the data set?**
Our data set consists of responses from various New Yorkers, most of which are our peers (our sphere is very limited, and thus we tried to get some responses from outside of Stuyvesant High School, but majority of our responses are Stuyvesant students.)

**Where did you get it from?**
Our data comes from a survey we conducted, which we posted in school Facebook groups and on our walls. 

**How much data do you have?** 
As of 12:56 AM, 12/18/2017, we have 53 responses. As of 1:40 AM, 12/20/2017, we have 118 responses, including a few that were ommitted from the analyses.

**What time range is covered?**
As of 12:56 AM, 12/18/2017, it has only been approximately 2 hours. As of 5:00 PM 12/20/17, it has been 

**Did you have to clean your data? What did you have to do?**
We had to clear out the responses that were not up to standards (for example, some did not put in their zipcodes and that's a perfectly valid concern. However, to submit a response without a zip code...they could've just exited the survey). We also had to check through everyone's hobbies because they did not follow instructions and pick one favorite; instead some just went to the other section and listed their favorite hobbies. For that situation, we either replaced their entry with "Other" in the csv file, or we changed their entry to a choice on the survey that they listed first (for example, someone listed "Photography, transit." We set his entry as Photography. However if his entry had been "transit, Photography," we would've set it as other).

**Did you notice biases in your data that might affect your results?**
The way we dealt with the hobbies people had was one bias. We're doing this based on an assumption that humans unconsciously list things in an order of perference. However, we aren't sure if that truely is the case. Another bias we had were our spheres of influence. Most of our responses are from Stuyvesant High School, which limits the age range and audience for this data. Because of this limitation, we are unable to extrapolate this data to accurately represent New Yorkers in general. Therefore, our conclusion, while directly received from the surveyed people, may be skewed due to factors unaccounted for, including ambiguous responses and sample size and type.

**What methods did you use to answer your questions?**
We created a survey using Google Forms to gather data. Then, we interpreted the relationship between the variables to determine the answer to our question. The analysis of the data is largely dependent on the sample size and type. We analyzed the data by..

**What statistics do you have that support or refute your hypothesis?**
Rather, it is the lack of statistics; although we did not expect over 100 responses, there is not enough data to either support or refute our hypothesis. We do see some correlation, but as stated before, there isn't enough evidence to accurately claim one thing. 

**The results support the hypothesis because…**
For only specific genres of music, there is a clear correlation. For the electronic music genre, there is a high number of people with gaming as their hobby. Everything else breaks even.

**Alternative interpretations of the results are…** 
Because all of our responses majority students, this is merely a representation of our age group. 

**The limitations of this method included…**
the fact that we were unable to gather as much data as we could have if we had chosen to use preexisting data sets from other sources, which may be larger and more accurate.

**More data science that you didn’t have time to do!**
We could've extended the time range for this survey. The amount of responses we got was pretty surprising, but the more data we could have, the more we would've had to work with. Additionally, the bigger our range of responses, the more variety and data we could've had. Specifically, majority of these respondants are students.
